title: A/B Testing Overview: Part One
---

A/B testing, or split testing, is a common practice for companies looking to increase conversion rates on their website. Conversion Rate is the ratio of visitors who convert content views or website visits into desired actions (typically sales or leads). In part one of my A/B testing post series I will show you a few of the resources that I have found incredibly helpful.

This guide is a great resource to get started learning about A/B testing. It will give you a high-level overview of what A/B testing is, as well as a few case studies of tests that have worked well for others.

Once you know what A/B testing is, you’ll need to know what to test, and the link above is a good starting point. For many it can be difficult to see points of your site that can be improved, but there are a number of online resources such as this one that can help you start out.

# [Split Test Confidence Calculator](http://www.usereffect.com/split-test-calculator)

While most A/B testing platforms have such a calculator built-in to their software, it can be helpful to check yourself if the data you have collected is enough to make a confident decision on a winning experience. As mentioned in the “Ultimate Guide to A/B Testing” link above, you should always make sure to not turn a test off early. Be confident in your testing process!

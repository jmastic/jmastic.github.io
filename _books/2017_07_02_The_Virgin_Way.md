# The Virgin Way - Richard Branson

## Part One - LISTEN
### Old Blocks and Young Chips
> You're guaranteed to miss every shot you don't take

### The Dying Art of Listening
> Leadership attributes: integrity, sense of humor, entrepreneurial spirit, ultra-gregarious, truly care about their people, be able to delegate work and credit where due  
> Nobody has ever learned anything listening to themselves speak  
> Get out into the thick of things on a regular basis  
> Take lots of notes

### Mirror Mirror
> Don't spend all your time obsessing over what the competition is up to
> Use some of that energy to look in the mirror to see how you appear to your employees
> Get out and kick the tires on your company regularly
> Look at your business from the "outside-in"
> Perception is reality

### K-I-S-S and Tell
> Keep is simple, stupid (and short)
> Regarding communications with internal employees and external (media, shareholders)
> Save a lot of heartache by knowing what you mean to say, and saying exactly that

### Burn Down the Mission
> If you must have a mission statement, keep it real, make it unique to your company, and keep it concise
> Try to imagine it on the bottom of a coat of arms

## Part Two - LEARN
### Defining Leadership
> It is typically difficult for an entrepreneur to run the business hands-on
> Delegate and lead the business at a bigger picture
> Know when to step back, and know when to step in

### What Change Luck?
> "You've got a problem - but let's see how we can try to fix it"
> Take advantage of social media as much as possible
> Live up to a reputation of being atypically customer-focused

### Typically Atypical
### Big Dogfights
> Do the right thing, and learn to respond quickly to events
> Don't be afraid to go after the "big dogs" in an industry
> Stay "low" for a bit, build your base, then hit it big
> Don't go after the "megabrands" immediately, you'll be torn apart

### Innovation is Nothing New
> "This works in practice, but not in theory"
> Think with a wide-angle lens. Entire experience (from customer's start to finish) may present new opportunities
> Find the existing pain points and solve them, enhance what's working now
> Customer experience needs to be of high focus
> Give employees a lifeline, but let them run free and build the business around a common goal

### Hiring 'em and Keeping 'em
> Being part of the hiring process is crucial to good leaders
> Train people well enough so they can leave, and treat them well enough so they don't want to
> Hire for personality first and foremost

## Part Three - LAUGH
### Culturing the Culture
> "Culture eats strategy for breakfast"
> Focus on nurturing your people and culturing the culture, not profits and growth
> "Everything begins and ends with our people. If we keep our employees happy and engaged, they will keep our customers happy who will then reward us with their loyalty. That repeat business helps our bottom line and creates value for our shareholders."

### The Fruits of Passion
> You cannot train someone to be passionate
> If that basic, smoldering fire is not innate then no amount of stoking will ever ignite it
> You don't train attitudes, you have to hire them
> Give people the autonomy, freedom, support, and highly flexible (except quality) brand image that allows them to go do amazing things

### The Party Line
> Fun is infectious, and good for the well-being of the individuals and the business.
> Everything that's worthwhile in life usually involves some degree of risk
> Enjoy a fun party with your company once in a while

## Part Four - LEAD
### Leaders of the Future
> Business can and must be a force for good
> No matter how big you are, going it alone is rarely a good or viable option
> Having a good mentor can be the difference in success and failure
> Mentors can open doors that previously looked impenetrable

### Being There
> Get out "there" and lead boldly and visibly from the front
> Step up and try "driving the chariot into battle"

### Collaboration is the Key
> Take down the silos of standard corporate structure
> Go in "piazza" mode which encourages collaboration
> Work to foster physically and emotionally unfettered corporate cultures and working environments

### Decisions, Decisions
> Indecision is not an option
> We will all make a lot of decisions big/small, good/bad
> As a leader, your job is to gather as much information as is available, step up, and take the bull by the horns

### Good Business
> Businesses need to give back to the community
> Take a strong stance against corruption and lobbying
> Balance the pursuit of enterprise with the needs of employees, society, and the environment

## Start it up
> Trust the process
> Trust your instincts
> Trust your team
> Don't second-guess yourself or worry about a few mistakes along the way
> "Just start it"
